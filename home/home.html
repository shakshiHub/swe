    <div class="home_titles about">ABOUT SWE++</div>
    <div class="text">
        <p>The Society of Women Engineers (SWE) at San Jose State University is on a mission to close the gender gap in technology by empowering the next generation of female tech leaders.
        We believe that every girl should have the opportunity to explore computer science and see her potential in this exciting field.
        SWE++ is a passionate committee within SWE dedicated to making this vision a reality.<br><br>
        For too long, the technology space has seen an imbalance, with far fewer women than men.
        Many young girls, ourselves included, may not encounter computer science until much later on in life or may lack the encouragement to pursue it.
        SWE++ aims to change that. Through a supportive and welcoming environment, we are committed to introducing middle school girls to the world of computing early, fostering confidence and excitement around technology.<br><br>

            Every spring, we invite middle school girls to join our free 10-week computer science program at San Jose State University.
            Together, we will explore programming languages like Python, learn computer science principles, work on hands-on projects, and build a community of young women ready to step into the world of tech. At SWE++, we are not just teaching skills, we are inspiring futures. </p>
