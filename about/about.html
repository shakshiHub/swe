        <p class="text">Hi! I am a fourth year Computer Science major at SJSU and this will be my third year being a part of SWE++! Growing up, I did not see many women in tech, and it often felt like coding was not meant for me. SWE++ means so much to me because I want more girls to feel confident and excited about exploring the world of coding. Outside of SWE++, I love drawing, listening to music, being outdoors, and playing with my hamster! I look forward to hosting another 10-week program, and I can not wait to inspire and connect with a new group of young girls who are curious about engineering!</p>

        <p class="text">Hi! I am Shakshi, a third-year Computer Science major at SJSU. I have previously taught computer science camps and loved seeing a kid's face light up as they learned and applied new skills. I am especially excited to encourage more young girls to dive into tech and be confident in their capabilities! Outside of computer science, I enjoy roller skating and playing board games with friends and family.</p>

        <p class="text">Hello everyone! My name is Natalie and I am a second year student at San Jose State studying Software Engineering. My hobbies outside of school include listening to music, racing on nitro type, and opening blind boxes. I remember my first engineering class that I took at San Jose State was taught by a woman and I was so inspired to learn from her. I am so excited to be participating in SWE++ this year and I am honored to be able to help more women break into tech!</p>
